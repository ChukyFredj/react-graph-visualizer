# React Graph Visualizer

**React Graph Visualizer** is an interactive web application designed to help users understand and visualize graph theory and algorithms. Through an intuitive, user-friendly interface, users can create various types of graphs and run algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Dijkstra's shortest path.

## Features

- **Graph Types**: Supports undirected, directed, and weighted graphs.
- **Node and Edge Interactions**: Add, connect, and delete nodes, and set weights on edges.
- **Algorithm Visualization**:
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Dijkstra's shortest path
- **Multi-Language Support**: English and French interfaces.
- **Real-Time Animations**: Visualize the traversal process with states: unvisited, visiting, and visited.
- **Color-Coded Legend**: Clear, color-coded feedback for node and edge states.

## How It Works

1. **Add Nodes and Edges**: Click on the canvas to add nodes, and click between two nodes to connect them with an edge.
2. **Select Graph Type**: Choose between undirected, directed, or weighted graphs.
3. **Pick an Algorithm**: Select an algorithm and a start node, then click "Run Algorithm" to watch it in action.
4. **Visual Feedback**: Each algorithm will update node and edge colors to represent different states, helping users understand the algorithm's behavior.
